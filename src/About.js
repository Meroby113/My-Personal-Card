            <p >Hello! I'm Merve, a computer engineering student at Istanbul Aydin University, and I'm passionate about Frontend Development. I constantly improve myself in the tech world by sharing my projects on GitHub. My goal is to pursue a career in Frontend Development in the future.
            </p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>Yoga and pilates are a way of life for me. They bring me a sense of tranquility while I pursue flexibility and fitness.
I have a deep love for swimming. The soothing embrace of the water is almost like therapy to me.
In my spare time, I find solace in sitting in silence for hours, listening to my inner thoughts. It helps me find spiritual peace and balance.
Of course, my passion for technology never wanes, and I always find it exciting to learn and experiment with new things.</p>
