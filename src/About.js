            <p >Hi, I'm Merve Çoban (also known as Meroby113) a final-year Computer Engineering student at İstanbul Aydın University with a passion for coding. I have immersed myself in both backend and frontend development, and I love working on projects that challenge me and help me grow as a software developer..

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>Yoga and pilates are a way of life for me. They bring me a sense of tranquility while I pursue flexibility and fitness.
I have a deep love for swimming. The soothing embrace of the water is almost like therapy to me.
In my spare time, I find solace in sitting in silence for hours, listening to my inner thoughts. It helps me find spiritual peace and balance.
Of course, my passion for technology never wanes, and I always find it exciting to learn and experiment with new things.</p>
